[Click here to play](https://lsr488.github.io/lanterns-roll-and-click/).

## **Set Up**
1. Click Roll 6 dice.
2. Assign 1 die to each ability (flip, increase/decrease, reroll 1, reroll any). Do so by clicking the ability name and inputting the chosen die's value.
3. Assign 1 unused die to the experience track. Do so by clicking the number of circles that correspond to the die's value.
4. The last die is assigned to the camp experience track. Do so by clicking the book icon in the camp on Path 5.
5. Click Reset Rolled Dice to get started.

## **How to Play**
1. **Step 1: Entering the Zone**
   - Begin by clicking Roll All Dice (6).
   - Any time you roll a (1), click 1 experience circle on the right-hand side.
   - If you rolled any of the dice needed for a particular zone, click Choose Dice and input the dice values, separated by commas. If you have all of the dice required to complete the zone, move on to Step 3 (Leaving the Zone). If not, continue to Step 2 (Fighting the Enemies).
2. **Step 2: Fighting the Enemies**
   - Manipulate the dice values by using the abilities on the right-hand side. Click on a circle in each ability line to activate the ability.
   - **Flip:** Flips the chosen die to the opposite side. E.G., (1) becomes (6), (2) becomes (5), (3) becomes (4), etc.
   - **Increase/Decrease:** Increase or decrease the value of the chosen die by 1. E.G., (5) could become a (6) or (4).
   - **Reroll 1:** Reroll any 1 die of your choice.
   - **Reroll Any:** Reroll any number of dice that haven't yet been kept to complete the zone. You can also reroll just 1 die.
   - Remember to click an Experience circle each time you roll a(1)!
   - The symbols **+** and **x** correspond to any die result (but all **+** must match, and all **x** must match within a zone). Zone 1 includes a three-of-a-kind. Zone 2 includes a pair. Zone 4 is two different three-of-a-kinds. In Zone 8, all dice must match.
   - Once you've chosen all of the dice required to complete a zone, proceed to Step 3 (Leaving the Zone).

3. **Step 3: Leaving the Zone**
   - To leave the zone, click the circle next to the zone number to mark it as complete.
   - If you complete an entire Experience row, you can add 1 circle to an ability of your choice (you'll be prompted to do this automatically). You can't have more than 7 circles per ability.
   - Proceed to the next zone (back to Step 1).

4. **Special Zone - Entering Zone 5 (The Bonfire / Camp)**
   - Click the circle next to the Reroll Any symbol in the camp. This will automatically add 1 circle to the Reroll Any ability on the right-hand side for future use.
   - Click the circle(s) next to the Exp symbol (an open book) in the camp. This will automatically add experience to the experience tracker on the right-hand side. If you've completed an Experience Row, you'll be prompted to increase an ability of your choice.
   - Once you've used all of the circles in camp, proceed to Step 3 (Leaving the Zone).

## **End of the Game**
   - You win the game if you're able to mark all zones as complete.
   - You lose if you have no ability cirlces left and you're unable to complete the zone.
   - Refresh the page to play again.

   - Your score is equal to the number of used ability circles. Your score will automatically be calculated. The lower the score, the better.
   - **16+** - Promising Adventurer
   - **5-15** - Master in Arms
   - **1-5** - Heroic Swashbuckler
